## Proportional Representation by Multiple Fractional Transferable Votes

This voting scheme is a hybrid of

    Proportional Representation by Single Transferable Vote,
    Open List Voting and
    Approval Range Voting.


Each voter can express multiple first preferences, multiple second preferences and so on, and there can be gaps e.g. no third preference, followed by several fourth or fifth preferences.

Each candidate on the list is either an individual or a sub-list. When selecting a sub-list there is a sub-vote to indicate preferences within the list. Sub-lists may contain further sub-lists.
